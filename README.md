# Concordion Integrations and Extensions

[Concordion](http://www.concordion.org/) is an open source runner for
executable specifications that creates rich living documentation.
This project allows to integrate Concordion with two popular
Java frameworks: [Spring](https://spring.io/projects/spring-framework) and
[Quarkus](https://quarkus.io/). These integrations enable developers to
use dependency injection and other features provided by these frameworks
in their Concordion specifications.

Additionally, this project includes a couple of useful extensions that
enhance the functionality of Concordion.

## Features

* [Quarkus Integration](quarkus/README.md)
* [Spring Integration](spring/README.md)
* [Screenshot Extension](screenshot/README.md)
* [Write Extension](write/README.md)
